### inference and reasoning - deductive vs inductive

  "Reasoning is deductive when enough information is at hand to permit it and inductive/plausible when necessary information is not available.

  Rules for deductive reasoning:  
  (1)  (if A is true, then B is true), (A is true) |- (B is true)  
  (2)  (if A is true, then B is true), (B is false) |- (A is false)  

  Rules for inductive/plausible reasoning:  
  (3)  (if A is true, then B is true), (B is true) |- (A becomes more plausible)  
  (4)  (if A is true, then B is true), (A is false) |- (B becomes less plausible)  
  (5)  (if A is true, then B becomes more plausible), (B is true) |- (A becomes more plausible)  
 
  The reasoning of a scientist, by which he accepts or rejects his theories, consists almost entirely of syllogisms of the kinds (2) and (3).

  Evidently, the deductive reasoning described above has the property that we can go through long chains of reasoning of the type (1) and (2) and the conclusions have just as much certainty as the premises. With the other kinds of reasoning, (3)–(5), the reliability of the conclusion changes as we go through several stages. But in their quantitative form we shall find that in many cases our conclusions can still approach the certainty of deductive reasoning. Pólya showed that even a pure mathematician actually uses these weaker forms of reasoning most of the time. Of course, on publishing a new theorem, the mathematician will try very hard to invent an argument which uses only the first kind; but the reasoning process which led to the theorem in the first place almost always involves one of the weaker forms (based, for example, on following up conjectures suggested by analogies). Good mathematicians see analogies between theorems; great mathematicians see analogies between analogies."

  "AI systems have to learn from experience, build models of the environment from the acquired knowledge, and use these models for prediction (and action). In philosophy this is called inductive inference, in statistics it is called estimation and prediction, and in computer science it is addressed by machine learning. There were several unsuccessful attempts and unsuitable approaches towards a general theory of uncertainty and induction, including Popper’s denial of induction, frequentist statistics, much of statistical learning theory, subjective Bayesianism, Carnap’s confirmation theory, the big data paradigm, eliminative induction, pluralism, and deductive and other approaches. I argue that Solomonoff’s formal, general, complete, consistent, and essentially unique theory provably solves most issues that have plagued other approaches."

  "Sequential decision theory formally solves the problem of rational agents in uncertain worlds if the true environmental prior probability distribution is known. Solomonoff's theory of universal induction formally solves the problem of sequence prediction for unknown prior distribution. AIXI combines both ideas and develop an elegant parameter-free theory of an optimal reinforcement learning agent embedded in an arbitrary unknown environment that possesses essentially all aspects of rational intelligence. The theory reduces all conceptual AI problems to pure computational ones. There are strong arguments that the resulting AIXI model is the most intelligent unbiased agent possible."

  "No free lunch myth relies on unrealistic uniform sampling (which results mostly in white noise for real-world phenomena). Sampling from Solomonoff's universal distribution permits free lunch."

  "AIXI applications (environments):  
  - *sequence prediction*:  predict weather or stock market (strong result - upper bound for approximation of true distribution)  
  - *strategic games*:  learn play well (minimax) zero-sum games (like chess) or even exploit limited capabilities of opponent  
  - *optimization*:  find (approximate) minimum of function with as few function calls as possible (difficult exploration versus exploitation problem)  
  - *supervised learning*:  learn functions by presenting (z, f(z)) pairs and ask for function values of z' presenting (z', ?) pairs (supervised learning is much faster than reinforcement learning)"  

  *(Marcus Hutter)*

  AIXI = learning + prediction + planning + acting

  AIXI is an algorithmic probability theory extended to the case of sequential decision theory.  
  AIXI defines universal agent which effectively simulates all possible programs which output agrees with agent’s set of observations.  
  AIXI is not computable but related agent AIXI-tl may be computed and is superior to any other agent bounded by time t and space l.  

  components of AIXI:  
  - Ockhams' razor (simplicity) principle  
  - Epicurus' principle of multiple explanations  
  - Bayes' rule for conditional probabilities  
  - Turing's universal machine  
  - Kolmogorov's complexity  
  - Solomonoff's universal prior distribution = Ockham + Epicurus + Bayes + Turing + Kolmogorov  
  - Bellman equations + Solomonoff = Universal Artificial Intelligence  


  "AIXI operates within the following agent model: There is an agent, and an environment, which is a computable function unknown to the agent. Thus the agent will need to have a probability distribution on the range of possible environments. On each clock tick, the agent receives an observation (a bitstring/number) from the environment, as well as a reward (another number). The agent then outputs an action (another number). To do this, AIXI guesses at a probability distribution for its environment, using Solomonoff induction, a formalization of Occam's razor: Simpler computations are more likely a priori to describe the environment than more complex ones. This probability distribution is then Bayes-updated by how well each model fits the evidence (or more precisely, by throwing out all computations which have not exactly fit the environmental data so far, but for technical reasons this is roughly equivalent as a model). AIXI then calculates the expected reward of each action it might choose--weighting the likelihood of possible environments as mentioned. It chooses the best action by extrapolating its actions into its future time horizon recursively, using the assumption that at each step into the future it will again choose the best possible action using the same procedure. Then, on each iteration, the environment provides an observation and reward as a function of the full history of the interaction; the agent likewise is choosing its action as a function of the full history. The agent's intelligence is defined by its expected reward across all environments, weighting their likelihood by their complexity."

  ![AIXI formula](http://www.hutter1.net/ai/aixi1linel.gif)

  "AIXI is an agent that interacts with an environment in cycles k=1,2,...,m. In cycle k, AIXI takes action ak (e.g. a limb movement) based on past perceptions o1 r1...ok-1 rk-1. Thereafter, the environment provides a (regular) observation ok (e.g. a camera image) to AIXI and a real-valued reward rk. The reward can be very scarce, e.g. just +1 (-1) for winning (losing) a chess game, and 0 at all other times. Then the next cycle k+1 starts. The expression shows that AIXI tries to maximize its total future reward rk+...+rm. If the environment is modeled by a deterministic program q, then the future perceptions ...okrk...omrm = U(q,a1..am) can be computed, where U is a universal (monotone Turing) machine executing q given a1..am. Since q is unknown, AIXI has to maximize its expected reward, i.e. average rk+...+rm over all possible future perceptions created by all possible environments q that are consistent with past perceptions. The simpler an environment, the higher is its a-priori contribution 2^-l(q), where simplicity is measured by the length l of program q. AIXI effectively learns by eliminating Turing machines q once they become inconsistent with the progressing history. Since noisy environments are just mixtures of deterministic environments, they are automatically included. The sums in the formula constitute the averaging process. Averaging and maximization have to be performed in chronological order, hence the interleaving of max and Σ (similarly to minimax for games). One can fix any finite action and perception space, any reasonable U, and any large finite lifetime m. This completely and uniquely defines AIXI's actions ak, which are limit-computable via the expression above (all quantities are known)."

  "The ultimate optimal Bayesian approach to machine learning is embodied by the AIXI model. Any computational problem can be phrased as the maximization of a reward function. AIXI is based on Solomonoff's universal mixture M of all computable probability distributions. If the probabilities of the world's responses to some reinforcement learning agent's actions are computable (there is no physical evidence against that), then the agent may predict its future sensory inputs and rewards using M instead of the true but unknown distribution. The agent can indeed act optimally by choosing those action sequences that maximize M-predicted reward. This may be dubbed the unbeatable, ultimate statistical approach to AI - it demonstrates the mathematical limits of what's possible. However, AIXI’s notion of optimality ignores computation time, which is the reason why we are still in business with less universal but more practically feasible approaches such as deep learning based on more limited local search techniques such as gradient descent."

  "Generally speaking, when it comes to Reinforcement Learning, it is indeed a good idea to train a recurrent neural network called M to become a predictive model of the world, and use M to train a separate controller network C which is supposed to generate reward-maximising action sequences. Marcus Hutter’s mathematically optimal universal AIXI also has a predictive world model M, and a controller C that uses M to maximise expected reward. Ignoring limited storage size, RNNs are general computers just like your laptop. That is, AIXI’s M is related to the RNN-based M above in the sense that both consider a very general space of predictive programs. AIXI’s M, however, really looks at all those programs simultaneously, while the RNN-based M uses a limited local search method such as gradient descent in program space (also known as backpropagation through time) to find a single reasonable predictive program (an RNN weight matrix). AIXI’s C always picks the action that starts the action sequence that yields maximal predicted reward, given the current M, which in a Bayes-optimal way reflects all the observations so far. The RNN-based C, however, uses a local search method (backpropagation through time) to optimise its program or weight matrix, using gradients derived from M. So in a way, my old RNN-based CM system of 1990 may be viewed as a limited, downscaled, sub-optimal, but at least computationally feasible approximation of AIXI."

  *(Juergen Schmidhuber)*

  "AIXI it is not a feasible AI, because Solomonoff induction is not computable."

  "AIXI only works over some finite time horizon, though any finite horizon can be chosen. But some environments may not interact over finite time horizons."

  "AIXI lacks a self-model. It extrapolates its own actions into the future indefinitely, on the assumption that it will keep working in the same way in the future. Though AIXI is an abstraction, any real AI would have a physical embodiment that could be damaged, and an implementation which could change its behavior due to bugs; and the AIXI formalism completely ignores these possibilities."

  "Solomonoff induction treats the world as a sort of qualia factory, a complicated mechanism that outputs experiences for the inductor. Its hypothesis space tacitly assumes a Cartesian barrier separating the inductor's cognition from the hypothesized programs generating the perceptions. Through that barrier, only sensory bits and action bits can pass. Real agents, on the other hand, will be in the world they're trying to learn about. A computable approximation of AIXI, like AIXI-tl, would be a physical object. Its environment would affect it in unseen and sometimes drastic ways; and it would have involuntary effects on its environment, and on itself. Solomonoff induction doesn't appear to be a viable conceptual foundation for artificial intelligence - not because it's an uncomputable idealization, but because it's Cartesian."

  [**exploration and intrinsic motivation**](https://github.com/brylevkirill/notes/blob/master/Reinforcement%20Learning.md#exploration-and-intrinsic-motivation)

----

  Intelligence can be seen as compression efficacy - the more one can compress data, the more one can understand it. Example of increase in compression efficacy: 1. raw observations of planetary orbits, 2. geocentric Ptolemaic epicycles, 3. heliocentric ellipses, 4. Newtonian mechanics, 5. general relativity, 6.? Under this view, compression of data is understanding, improvement of compressor is learning, progress of improvement is intrinsic reward. To learn as fast as possible about a piece of data, one should decrease as rapidly as possible the number of bits one need to compress that data. If one can choose which data to observe or create, one should interact with environment in a way to obtain data that maximizes the decrease in bits (the compression progress) of everything already known.

----

  "Intrinsic motivation objective for an artificially curious/creative agent is to maximize the amount of model-learning progress, measured as the difference in compression of agent's experience before and after learning."

  "What experiments should an agent’s reinforcement learning controller, C, conduct to generate data that quickly improves agent's adaptive, predictive world model, M, which in turn can help to plan ahead? The theory says: use the learning progress of M (typically compression progress and speed-ups) as the intrinsic reward or fun for C. This motivates C to create action sequences (experiments) such that M can quickly discover new, previously unknown regularities."

  "Humans, even as infants, invent their own tasks in a curious and creative fashion, continually increasing their problem solving repertoire even without an external reward or teacher. They seem to get intrinsic reward for creating experiments leading to observations that obey a previously unknown law that allows for better compression of the observations—corresponding to the discovery of a temporarily interesting, subjectively novel regularity. For example, a video of 100 falling apples can be greatly compressed via predictive coding once the law of gravity is discovered. Likewise, the video-like image sequence perceived while moving through an office can be greatly compressed by constructing an internal 3D model of the office space. The 3D model allows for re-computing the entire high-resolution video from a compact sequence of very low-dimensional eye coordinates and eye directions. The model itself can be specified by far fewer bits of information than needed to store the raw pixel data of a long video. Even if the 3D model is not precise, only relatively few extra bits will be required to encode the observed deviations from the predictions of the model. Even mirror neurons are easily explained as by-products of history compression. They fire both when an animal acts and when the animal observes the same action performed by another. Due to mutual algorithmic information shared by perceptions of similar actions performed by various animals, efficient predictive coding profits from using the same feature detectors (neurons) to encode the shared information, thus saving storage space."

  "In the real world external rewards are rare. Agents using additional intrinsic rewards for model-learning progress will be motivated to learn many useful behaviors even in absence of external rewards, behaviors that lead to predictable or compressible results and thus reflect regularities in the environment, such as repeatable patterns in the world’s reactions to certain action sequences. Often a bias towards exploring previously unknown environmental regularities through artificial curiosity/creativity is a priori desirable because goal-directed learning may greatly profit from it, as behaviors leading to external reward may often be rather easy to compose from previously learnt curiosity-driven behaviors. It may be possible to formally quantify this bias towards novel patterns in form of a mixture-based prior, a weighted sum of probability distributions on sequences of actions and resulting inputs, and derive precise conditions for improved expected external reward intake. Intrinsic reward may be viewed as analogous to a regularizer in supervised learning, where the prior distribution on possible hypotheses greatly influences the most probable interpretation of the data in a Bayesian framework."

>	"We motivate controller network C to become an efficient explorer and an artificial scientist, by adding to its standard external reward (or fitness) for solving user-given tasks another intrinsic reward for generating novel action sequences (= experiments) that allow world model network M to improve its compression performance on the resulting data. At first glance, repeatedly evaluating M’s compression performance on the entire history seems impractical. A heuristic to overcome this is to focus on M’s improvements on the most recent trial, while regularly re-training M on randomly selected previous trials, to avoid catastrophic forgetting. A related problem is that C’s incremental program search may find it difficult to identify (and assign credit to) those parts of C responsible for improvements of a huge, black box-like, monolithic M. But we can implement M as a self-modularizing, computation cost-minimizing, winner-take-all RNN. Then it is possible to keep track of which parts of M are used to encode which parts of the history. That is, to evaluate weight changes of M, only the affected parts of the stored history have to be re-tested. Then C’s search can be facilitated by tracking which parts of C affected those parts of M. By penalizing C’s programs for the time consumed by such tests, the search for C is biased to prefer programs that conduct experiments causing data yielding quickly verifiable compression progress of M. That is, the program search will prefer to change weights of M that are not used to compress large parts of the history that are expensive to verify. The first implementations of this simple principle were described in our work on the POWERPLAY framework, which incrementally searches the space of possible pairs of new tasks and modifications of the current program, until it finds a more powerful program that, unlike the unmodified program, solves all previously learned tasks plus the new one, or simplifies/compresses/speeds up previous solutions, without forgetting any."

----

  "To learn as fast as possible about a piece of data, decrease as rapidly as possible the number of bits you need to compress that data. This is exactly how probabilistic models are trained: ∇-log Pr(x). But what if you can choose which data to observe or even create your own? You should create the data that maximises the decrease in bits - the compression progress - of everything else you and your peers have ever observed. In other words, create the thing that makes the most sense of the world: art, science, music, jokes... Happiness is the first derivative of life!"

  "Self-improving universal methods have also been defined, including some that justify self-changes (including changes of the learning algorithm) through empirical evidence in a lifelong learning context and the Goedel Machine that self-improves via proving theorems about itself, and can improve any part of its software (including the learning algorithm itself) in a way that is provably time-optimal in a sense that takes constant overheads into account and goes beyond asymptotic optimality. At each step of the way, the Goedel Machine takes the action that it can prove, according to its axiom system and its perceptual data, will be the best way to achieve its goals. The current versions of the Goedel Machine are not computationally tractable in complex environments, however."

  "Goedel machines are limited by the basic limits of math and computation identified by the founder of modern theoretical computer science himself, Kurt Goedel: some theorems are true but cannot be proven by any computational theorem proving procedure (unless the axiomatic system itself is flawed). That is, in some situations the GM may never find a proof of the benefits of some change to its own code."

  "MC-AIXI is a probabilistic approximation of AIXI. What might be the equivalent for the self-referential proof searcher of a GM? One possibility comes to mind: Holographic proofs, where errors in the derivation of a theorem are 'apparent after checking just a negligible fraction of bits of the proof'."

  "A Goedel Machine may indeed change its utility function and target theorem, but not in some arbitrary way. It can do so only if the change is provably useful according to its initial utility function. E.g., it may be useful to replace some complex-looking utility function by an equivalent simpler one. In certain environments, a Goedel Machine may even prove the usefulness of deleting its own proof searcher, and stop proving utility-related theorems, e.g., when the expected computational costs of proof search exceed the expected reward."

  *(Juergen Schmidhuber)*

----

  "It’s currently not sufficiently formalized, so it’s difficult to state if and how it really works. Searching for proofs is extremely complicated: Making a parallel with Levin search, where given a goal output string (an improvement in the Goedel Machine), you enumerate programs (propositions in the Goedel Machine) and run them to see if they output the goal string (search for a proof of improvement in Goedel Machine). This last part is the problem: in Levin Search, the programs are fast to run, whereas in Goedel Machine there is an additional search step for each proposition, so this looks very roughly like going from exponential (Levin Search) to double-exponential (Goedel Machine). And Levin Search is already not really practical. Theorem proving is even more complicated when you need to prove that there will be an improvement of the system at an unknown future step. Maybe it would work better if the kinds of proofs were limited to some class, for example use simulation of the future steps up to some horizon given a model of the world. These kinds of proofs are easier to check and have a guaranteed termination, e.g. if the model class for the environment is based on Schmidhuber’s Speed Prior. But this starts to look pretty much like an approximation of AIXI."

### interesting papers - definitions and measures of intelligence


#### ["Universal Intelligence: A Definition of Machine Intelligence"](http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.3329) Legg, Hutter
>	"A fundamental problem in artificial intelligence is that nobody really knows what intelligence is. The problem is especially acute when we need to consider artificial systems which are significantly different to humans. In this paper we approach this problem in the following way: We take a number of well known informal definitions of human intelligence that have been given by experts, and extract their essential features. These are then mathematically formalised to produce a general measure of intelligence for arbitrary machines. We believe that this equation formally captures the concept of machine intelligence in the broadest reasonable sense. We then show how this formal definition is related to the theory of universal optimal learning agents. Finally, we survey the many other tests and definitions of intelligence that have been proposed for machines."

#### ["Provably Bounded-Optimal Agents"](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9505103) Russell, Subramanian
>	"Since its inception, artificial intelligence has relied upon a theoretical foundation centered around perfect rationality as the desired property of intelligent systems. We argue, as others have done, that this foundation is inadequate because it imposes fundamentally unsatisfiable requirements. As a result, there has arisen a wide gap between theory and practice in AI, hindering progress in the field. We propose instead a property called bounded optimality. Roughly speaking, an agent is bounded-optimal if its program is a solution to the constrained optimization problem presented by its architecture and the task environment. We show how to construct agents with this property for a simple class of machine architectures in a broad class of real-time environments. We illustrate these results using a simple model of an automated mail sorting facility. We also define a weaker property, asymptotic bounded optimality (ABO), that generalizes the notion of optimality in classical complexity theory. We then construct universal ABO programs, i.e., programs that are ABO no matter what real-time constraints are applied. Universal ABO programs can be used as building blocks for more complex systems. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects for bounded optimality as a theoretical basis for AI, and relate it to similar trends in philosophy, economics, and game theory."


#### ["Space-Time Embedded Intelligence"](http://frontiersinai.com/turingfiles/December/orseau.pdf) Orseau, Ring
>	"This paper presents the first formal measure of intelligence for agents fully embedded within their environment. Whereas previous measures such as Legg’s universal intelligence measure and Russell’s bounded optimality provide theoretical insights into agents that interact with an external world, ours describes an intelligence that is computed by, can be modified by, and is subject to the time and space constraints of the environment with which it interacts. Our measure merges and goes beyond Legg’s and Russell’s, leading to a new, more realistic definition of artificial intelligence that we call Space-Time Embedded Intelligence."


#### ["Evaluation in Artificial Intelligence: From Task-oriented to Ability-oriented Measurement"](https://riunet.upv.es/handle/10251/83598) Hernandez-Orallo
>	"The evaluation of artificial intelligence systems and components is crucial for the progress of the discipline. In this paper we describe and critically assess the different ways AI systems are evaluated, and the role of components and techniques in these systems. We first focus on the traditional task-oriented evaluation approach. We identify three kinds of evaluation: human discrimination, problem benchmarks and peer confrontation. We describe some of the limitations of the many evaluation schemes and competitions in these three categories, and follow the progression of some of these tests. We then focus on a less customary (and challenging) ability-oriented evaluation approach, where a system is characterised by its (cognitive) abilities, rather than by the tasks it is designed to solve. We discuss several possibilities: the adaptation of cognitive tests used for humans and animals, the development of tests derived from algorithmic information theory or more integrated approaches under the perspective of universal psychometrics. We analyse some evaluation tests from AI that are better positioned for an ability-oriented evaluation and discuss how their problems and limitations can possibly be addressed with some of the tools and ideas that appear within the paper. Finally, we enumerate a series of lessons learnt and generic guidelines to be used when an AI evaluation scheme is under consideration."

#### ["On the Measure of Intelligence"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547) Chollet
>	"To make deliberate progress towards more intelligent and more human-like artificial systems, we need to be following an appropriate feedback signal: we need to be able to define and evaluate intelligence in a way that enables comparisons between two systems, as well as comparisons with humans. Over the past hundred years, there has been an abundance of attempts to define and measure intelligence, across both the fields of psychology and AI. We summarize and critically assess these definitions and evaluation approaches, while making apparent the two historical conceptions of intelligence that have implicitly guided them.  We note that in practice, the contemporary AI community still gravitates towards benchmarking intelligence by comparing the skill exhibited by AIs and humans at specific tasks, such as board games and video games. We argue that solely measuring skill at any given task falls short of measuring intelligence, because skill is heavily modulated by prior knowledge and experience: unlimited priors or unlimited training data allow experimenters to “buy” arbitrary levels of skills for a system, in a way that masks the system’s own generalization power. We then articulate a new formal definition of intelligence based on Algorithmic Information Theory, describing intelligence as skill-acquisition efficiency and highlighting the concepts of scope, generalization difficulty, priors, and experience, as critical pieces to be accounted for in characterizing intelligent systems. Using this definition, we propose a set of guidelines for what a general AI benchmark should look like. Finally, we present a new benchmark closely following these guidelines, the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), built upon an explicit set of priors designed to be as close as possible to innate human priors. We argue that ARC can be used to measure a human-like form of general fluid intelligence and that it enables fair general intelligence comparisons between AI systems and humans."


#### ["Measuring Intelligence through Games"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1314) Schaul, Togelius, Schmidhuber
>	"Artificial general intelligence refers to research aimed at tackling the full problem of artificial intelligence, that is, create truly intelligent agents. This sets it apart from most AI research which aims at solving relatively narrow domains, such as character recognition, motion planning, or increasing player satisfaction in games. But how do we know when an agent is truly intelligent? A common point of reference in the AGI community is Legg and Hutter’s formal definition of universal intelligence, which has the appeal of simplicity and generality but is unfortunately incomputable. Games of various kinds are commonly used as benchmarks for “narrow” AI research, as they are considered to have many important properties. We argue that many of these properties carry over to the testing of general intelligence as well. We then sketch how such testing could practically be carried out. The central part of this sketch is an extension of universal intelligence to deal with finite time, and the use of sampling of the space of games expressed in a suitably biased game description language."

#### ["Building Machines That Learn and Think Like People"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00289) Lake, Ullman, Tenenbaum, Gershman
>	"Recent progress in artificial intelligence has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn, and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (a) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (b) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology, to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (c) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes towards these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models."

### interesting papers - universal artificial intelligence


#### ["On Universal Prediction and Bayesian Confirmation"](http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.1516) Hutter
  `Solomonoff induction`
>	"The Bayesian framework is a well-studied and successful framework for inductive reasoning, which includes hypothesis testing and confirmation, parameter estimation, sequence prediction, classification, and regression. But standard statistical guidelines for choosing the model class and prior are not always available or fail, in particular in complex situations. Solomonoff completed the Bayesian framework by providing a rigorous, unique, formal, and universal choice for the model class and the prior. We discuss in breadth how and in which sense universal (non-i.i.d.) sequence prediction solves various (philosophical) problems of traditional Bayesian sequence prediction. We show that Solomonoff's model possesses many desirable properties: Strong total and weak instantaneous bounds, and in contrast to most classical continuous prior densities has no zero p(oste)rior problem, i.e. can confirm universal hypotheses, is reparametrization and regrouping invariant, and avoids the old-evidence and updating problem. It even performs well (actually better) in non-computable environments."

>	"The goal of the paper was to establish a single, universal theory for (sequence) prediction and (hypothesis) confirmation, applicable to all inductive inference problems. I started by showing that Bayesian prediction is consistent for any countable model class, provided it contains the true distribution. The major (agonizing) problem Bayesian statistics leaves open is how to choose the model class and the prior. Solomonoff’s theory fills this gap by choosing the class of all computable (stochastic) models, and a universal prior inspired by Ockham and Epicurus, and quantified by Kolmogorov complexity. I discussed in breadth how and in which sense this theory solves the inductive inference problem, by studying a plethora of problems other approaches suffer from. In one line: All you need for universal prediction is Ockham, Epicurus, Bayes, Solomonoff, Kolmogorov, and Turing. By including Bellman, one can extend this theory to universal decisions in reactive environments."

#### ["Is there an Elegant Universal Theory of Prediction?"](http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0606070) Legg
  `Solomonoff induction`
>	"Solomonoff induction is an elegant and extremely general model of inductive learning. It neatly brings together the philosophical principles of Occam’s razor, Epicurus’ principle of multiple explanations, Bayes theorem and Turing’s model of universal computation into a theoretical sequence predictor with astonishingly powerful properties. If theoretical models of prediction can have such elegance and power, one cannot help but wonder whether similarly beautiful and highly general computable theories of prediction are also possible.
>	What we have shown here is that there does not exist an elegant constructive theory of prediction for computable sequences, even if we assume unbounded computational resources, unbounded data and learning time, and place moderate bounds on the Kolmogorov complexity of the sequences to be predicted. Very powerful computable predictors are therefore necessarily complex. We have further shown that the source of this problem is computable sequences which are extremely expensive to compute. While we have proven that very powerful prediction algorithms which can learn to predict these sequences exist, we have also proven that, unfortunately, mathematical analysis cannot be used to discover these algorithms due to problems of Goedel incompleteness.
>	These results can be extended to more general settings, specifically to those problems which are equivalent to, or depend on, sequence prediction. Consider, for example, a reinforcement learning agent interacting with an environment. In each interaction cycle the agent must choose its actions so as to maximise the future rewards that it receives from the environment. Of course the agent cannot know for certain whether or not some action will lead to rewards in the future, thus it must predict these. Clearly, at the heart of reinforcement learning lies a prediction problem, and so the results for computable predictors presented in this paper also apply to computable reinforcement learners. More specifically, it follows that very powerful computable reinforcement learners are necessarily complex, and it follows that it is impossible to discover extremely powerful reinforcement learning algorithms mathematically."

In contrast, the field of universal reinforcement learning is concerned with algorithms that make as few assumptions as possible about the environment. The universal Bayesian agent AIXI and a family of related URL algorithms have been developed in this setting. While numerous theoretical optimality results have been proven for these agents, there has been no empirical investigation of their behavior to date. We present a short and accessible survey of these URL algorithms under a unified notation and framework, along with results of some experiments that qualitatively illustrate some properties of the resulting policies, and their relative performance on partially-observable gridworld environments. We also present an opensource reference implementation of the algorithms which we hope will facilitate further understanding of, and experimentation with, these ideas."

Solomonoff’s theory of universal induction formally solves the problem of sequence prediction for unknown prior distribution. We combine both ideas and get a parameter-free theory of universal Artificial Intelligence. We give strong arguments that the resulting AIXI model is the most intelligent unbiased agent possible. We outline how the AIXI model can formally solve a number of problem classes, including sequence prediction, strategic games, function minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning. The major drawback of the AIXI model is that it is uncomputable. To overcome this problem, we construct a modified algorithm AIXItl that is still effectively more intelligent than any other time t and length l bounded agent. The computation time of AIXItl is of the order t·2^l. The discussion includes formal definitions of intelligence order relations, the horizon problem and relations of the AIXI theory to other AI approaches."

We answer this hitherto open question in the affirmative, by providing the first computationally feasible approximation to the AIXI agent. To develop our approximation, we introduce a new Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm along with an agent-specific extension to the Context Tree Weighting algorithm. Empirically, we present a set of encouraging results on a variety of stochastic and partially observable domains. We conclude by proposing a number of directions for future research."

>	"This paper presents the first computationally feasible general reinforcement learning agent that directly and scalably approximates the AIXI ideal. Although well established theoretically, it has previously been unclear whether the AIXI theory could inspire the design of practical agent algorithms. Our work answers this question in the affirmative: empirically, our approximation achieves strong performance and theoretically, we can characterise the range of environments in which our agent is expected to perform well. To develop our approximation, we introduced two new algorithms: ρUCT, a Monte-Carlo expectimax approximation technique that can be used with any online Bayesian approach to the general reinforcement learning problem and FAC-CTW, a generalisation of the powerful CTW algorithm to the agent setting. In addition, we highlighted a number of interesting research directions that could improve the performance of our current agent; in particular, model class expansion and the online learning of heuristic rollout policies for ρUCT."

  `AIXI agent`
>	"How could we solve the machine learning and the artificial intelligence problem if we had infinite computation? Solomonoff induction and the reinforcement learning agent AIXI are proposed answers to this question. Both are known to be incomputable. In this paper, we quantify this using the arithmetical hierarchy, and prove upper and corresponding lower bounds for incomputability. We show that AIXI is not limit computable, thus it cannot be approximated using finite computation. Our main result is a limit-computable ε-optimal version of AIXI with infinite horizon that maximizes expected rewards."

  `AIXI agent`
>	"A big open question of algorithmic information theory is the choice of the universal Turing machine. For Kolmogorov complexity and Solomonoff induction we have invariance theorems: the choice of the UTM changes bounds only by a constant. For the universally intelligent agent AIXI no invariance theorem is known. Our results are entirely negative: we discuss cases in which unlucky or adversarial choices of the UTM cause AIXI to misbehave drastically. We show that Legg-Hutter intelligence and thus balanced Pareto optimality is entirely subjective, and that every policy is Pareto optimal in the class of all computable environments. This undermines all existing optimality properties for AIXI. While it may still serve as a gold standard for AI, our results imply that AIXI is a relative theory, dependent on the choice of the UTM."

>	"The choice of the universal Turing machine has been a big open question in algorithmic information theory for a long time. While attempts have been made no answer is in sight. The Kolmogorov complexity of a string, the length of the shortest program that prints this string, depends on this choice. However, there are invariance theorems which state that changing the UTM changes Kolmogorov complexity only by a constant. When using the universal prior M introduced by Solomonoff to predict any deterministic computable binary sequence, the number of wrong predictions is bounded by (a multiple of) the Kolmogorov complexity of the sequence. Due to the invariance theorem, changing the UTM changes the number of errors only by a constant. In this sense, compression and prediction work for any choice of UTM. Hutter defines the universally intelligent agent AIXI, which is targeted at the general reinforcement learning problem. It extends Solomonoff induction to the interactive setting. AIXI is a Bayesian agent, using a universal prior on the set of all computable environments; actions are taken according to the maximization of expected future discounted rewards. Closely related is the intelligence measure defined by Legg and Hutter, a mathematical performance measure for general reinforcement learning agents: defined as the discounted rewards achieved across all computable environments, weighted by the universal prior. There are several known positive results about AIXI. It has been proven to be Pareto optimal, balanced Pareto optimal, and has maximal Legg-Hutter intelligence. Furthermore, AIXI asymptotically learns to predict the environment perfectly and with a small total number of errors analogously to Solomonoff induction, but only on policy: AIXI learns to correctly predict the value (expected future rewards) of its own actions, but generally not the value of counterfactual actions that it does not take. Orseau showed that AIXI does not achieve asymptotic optimality in all computable environments. So instead, we may ask the following weaker questions. Does AIXI succeed in every partially observable Markov decision process/(ergodic) Markov decision process/bandit problem/sequence prediction task? In this paper we show that without further assumptions on the UTM, we cannot answer any of the preceding questions in the affirmative. More generally, there can be no invariance theorem for AIXI. As a reinforcement learning agent, AIXI has to balance between exploration and exploitation. Acting according to any (universal) prior does not lead to enough exploration, and the bias of AIXI’s prior is retained indefinitely. For bad priors this can cause serious malfunctions. However, this problem can be alleviated by adding an extra exploration component to AIXI, similar to knowledge-seeking agents, or by the use of optimism. We give two examples of universal priors that cause AIXI to misbehave drastically. In case of a finite lifetime, the indifference prior makes all actions equally preferable to AIXI. Furthermore, for any computable policy π the dogmatic prior makes AIXI stick to the policy π as long as expected future rewards do not fall too close to zero. This has profound implications. We show that if we measure Legg-Hutter intelligence with respect to a different universal prior, AIXI scores arbitrarily close to the minimal intelligence while any computable policy can score arbitrarily close to the maximal intelligence. This makes the Legg-Hutter intelligence score and thus balanced Pareto optimality relative to the choice of the UTM. Moreover, we show that in the class of all computable environments, every policy is Pareto optimal. This undermines all existing optimality results for AIXI. We discuss the implications of these results for the quest for a natural universal Turing machine and optimality notions of general reinforcement learners."

#### ["Nonparametric General Reinforcement Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08944) Leike
  `Thompson Sampling AIXI agent`
>	"Reinforcement learning problems are often phrased in terms of Markov decision processes. In this thesis we go beyond MDPs and consider reinforcement learning in environments that are non-Markovian, non-ergodic and only partially observable. Our focus is not on practical algorithms, but rather on the fundamental underlying problems: How do we balance exploration and exploitation? How do we explore optimally? When is an agent optimal? We follow the nonparametric realizable paradigm: we assume the data is drawn from an unknown source that belongs to a known countable class of candidates.  
>	First, we consider the passive (sequence prediction) setting, learning from data that is not independent and identically distributed. We collect results from artificial intelligence, algorithmic information theory, and game theory and put them in a reinforcement learning context: they demonstrate how agent can learn the value of its own policy. Next, we establish negative results on Bayesian reinforcement learning agents, in particular AIXI. We show that unlucky or adversarial choices of the prior cause the agent to misbehave drastically. Therefore Legg-Hutter intelligence and balanced Pareto optimality, which depend crucially on the choice of the prior, are entirely subjective. Moreover, in the class of all computable environments every policy is Pareto optimal. This undermines all existing optimality properties for AIXI.  
>	However, there are Bayesian approaches to general reinforcement learning that satisfy objective optimality guarantees: We prove that Thompson sampling is asymptotically optimal in stochastic environments in the sense that its value converges to the value of the optimal policy. We connect asymptotic optimality to regret given a recoverability assumption on the environment that allows the agent to recover from mistakes. Hence Thompson sampling achieves sublinear regret in these environments.  
>	AIXI is known to be incomputable. We quantify this using the arithmetical hierarchy, and establish upper and corresponding lower bounds for incomputability. Further, we show that AIXI is not limit computable, thus cannot be approximated using finite computation. However there are limit computable ε-optimal approximations to AIXI. We also derive computability bounds for knowledge-seeking agents, and give a limit computable weakly asymptotically optimal reinforcement learning agent.  
>	Finally, our results culminate in a formal solution to the grain of truth problem: A Bayesian agent acting in a multi-agent environment learns to predict the other agents’ policies if its prior assigns positive probability to them (the prior contains a grain of truth). We construct a large but limit computable class containing a grain of truth and show that agents based on Thompson sampling over this class converge to play ε-Nash equilibria in arbitrary unknown computable multi-agent environments."  

----
>	"Recently it was revealed that these optimality notions are trivial or subjective: a Bayesian agent does not explore enough to lose the prior’s bias, and a particularly bad prior can make the agent conform to any arbitrarily bad policy as long as this policy yields some rewards. These negative results put the Bayesian approach to (general) RL into question. We remedy the situation by showing that using Bayesian techniques an agent can indeed be optimal in an objective sense."  
>	"The agent we consider is known as Thompson sampling or posterior sampling. It samples an environment ρ from the posterior, follows the ρ-optimal policy for one effective horizon (a lookahead long enough to encompass most of the discount function’s mass), and then repeats. We show that this agent’s policy is asymptotically optimal in mean (and, equivalently, in probability). Furthermore, using a recoverability assumption on the environment, and some (minor) assumptions on the discount function, we prove that the worst-case regret is sublinear. This is the first time convergence and regret bounds of Thompson sampling have been shown under such general conditions."

  `knowledge-seeking` `KL-KSA agent`
>	"We define an optimal Bayesian knowledge-seeking agent, KL-KSA, designed for countable hypothesis classes of stochastic environments and whose goal is to gather as much information about the unknown world as possible. Although this agent works for arbitrary countable classes and priors, we focus on the especially interesting case where all stochastic computable environments are considered and the prior is based on Solomonoff’s universal prior. Among other properties, we show that KL-KSA learns the true environment in the sense that it learns to predict the consequences of actions it does not take. We show that it does not consider noise to be information and avoids taking actions leading to inescapable traps. We also present a variety of toy experiments demonstrating that KL-KSA behaves according to expectation."

----
>	"Reinforcement learning agents like Hutter’s universal, Pareto optimal, incomputable AIXI heavily rely on the definition of the rewards, which are necessarily given by some “teacher” to define the tasks to solve. Therefore, as is, AIXI cannot be said to be a fully autonomous agent. From the point of view of artificial general intelligence, this can be argued to be an incomplete definition of a generally intelligent agent. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that AIXI can converge to a suboptimal behavior in certain situations, hence showing the intrinsic difficulty of RL, with its non-obvious pitfalls. We propose a new model of intelligence, the knowledge-seeking agent, halfway between Solomonoff induction and AIXI, that defines a completely autonomous agent that does not require a teacher. The goal of this agent is not to maximize arbitrary rewards, but to entirely explore its world in an optimal way. A proof of strong asymptotic optimality for a class of horizon functions shows that this agent behaves according to expectation. Some implications of such an unusual agent are proposed."

>	"We defined a new kind of universal intelligent agents, named knowledge-seeking agents, which differ significantly from the traditional reinforcement learning framework and its associated universal optimal learner AIXI: Their purpose is not to solve particular, narrow tasks, given or defined by experts like humans, but to be fully autonomous and to depend on no external intelligent entity. Full autonomy is an important property if we are to create generally intelligent agents, that should match or surpass (collective) human intelligence. We believe such agents (or their computational variants) should turn out to be useful to humanity in a different way than RL agents, since they should constantly be creative and solve interesting problems that we may not yet know. It seems that this kind of agent can still be directed to some extent, either by using pieces of knowledge as rewards, or by controlling the parts of the environment the agent interacts with, or by giving it prior knowledge. But these are only temporary biases that decrease in strength as the agent acquires knowledge, in the convergence to optimality. In the real world, where all agents are mortal in some way, it is unlikely that a KSA would be too curious so as to threaten its own life, since a (predicted) death would prevent it from acquiring more knowledge. From a game theory perspective, knowledge-seeking is a positive-sum game, and all the players should cooperate to maximize their knowledge. This is an interesting property regarding the safety of other intelligent agents, as long as they are interested in knowledge (which humans seem to be, at least to some point). However, this alone cannot ensure complete safety because, as soon as several agents have limited resources, a conflict situation can occur, which is not good news for the less “powerful” of the agents."

  `knowledge-seeking` `BayesExp agent`
>	"Reinforcement learning is the task of learning to act well in a variety of unknown environments. The traditional approach is to study small classes and construct computationally and data efficient algorithms to minimise some form of loss function such as regret or sample-complexity. The grand dream, however, is to solve the problem where the class of possible environments is sufficiently large to include any challenge that might reasonably be faced by an agent living in this universe. Such a universal agent could learn to play chess, do the washing up, make money in finance, understand language, write beautiful poetry (if rewarding) and generally act with (super) human intelligence. The task is so difficult that in this thesis I decouple the problems of data and computation efficiency and focus only on the former. What is an upper bound on the rate of learning and what is the largest class of environments for which learning is possible? How can intelligence be measured? What ought the loss function be? Since these problems cannot (yet) be tackled experimentally, I take a theoretical approach, sometimes even constructing agents that provably cannot be computed. I consider both the prediction setting where actions/predictions do not affect the environment, as well as the full reinforcement learning case. In both cases I derive asymptotic results and finite sample-complexity bounds on the performance of some predictor or policy in very general settings where data is typically non-stationary and dependent (even non-Markov). In some extreme cases learning is impossible, so some results are unfortunately quite negative, especially in the reinforcement learning framework. Nevertheless, provided the environment class is not too large I show that some form of learning is usually possible."

----
>	"The idea behind the BayesExp agent is simple. Given that KL-KSA is effective at exploring, and AIXI is effective (by construction) at exploiting the agent’s beliefs as they stand: why not combine the two in some way? The algorithm for running BayesExp is simple: run AIXI by computing the ξ-optimal policy as normal, but at all times compute the value of the information-seeking policy πKSA. If the expected information gain (up to some horizon) exceeds some threshold, run the knowledge-seeking policy for an effective horizon. This combines the best of AIXI and KSA, by going on bursts of exploration when the agent’s beliefs suggest that the time is right to do so; thus, BayesExp breaks out of the sub-optimal exploration strategy of Bayes, but without resorting to ugly heuristics such as Epsilon-greedy. Crucially, it explores infinitely often, which is necessary for asymptotic optimality. Essentially, the BayesExp agent keeps track of two value functions: the Bayes-optimal value V∗ξ, and the ξ-expected information gain value V∗ξIG. It then checks whether V∗ξIG exceeds some threshold, εt. If it does, then it will explore for an effective horizon Ht(εt), and otherwise it will exploit using the Bayes-optimal policy π∗ξ."

#### ["Goedel Machines: Self-Referential Universal Problem Solvers Making Provably Optimal Self-Improvements"](http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0309048) Schmidhuber
>	"We present the first class of mathematically rigorous, general, fully self-referential, self-improving, optimally efficient problem solvers. Inspired by Kurt Goedel's celebrated self-referential formulas, such a problem solver rewrites any part of its own code as soon as it has found a proof that the rewrite is useful, where the problem-dependent utility function and the hardware and the entire initial code are described by axioms encoded in an initial proof searcher which is also part of the initial code. The searcher systematically and efficiently tests computable proof techniques (programs whose outputs are proofs) until it finds a provably useful, computable self-rewrite. We show that such a self-rewrite is globally optimal - no local maxima! - since the code first had to prove that it is not useful to continue the proof search for alternative self-rewrites. Unlike previous non-self-referential methods based on hardwired proof searchers, ours not only boasts an optimal order of complexity but can optimally reduce any slowdowns hidden by the O()-notation, provided the utility of such speed-ups is provable at all."

>	"The initial software p(1) of our Goedel machine runs an initial, typically sub-optimal problem solver, e.g., one of Hutter’s approaches which have at least an optimal order of complexity, or some less general method. Simultaneously, it runs an O()-optimal initial proof searcher using an online variant of Universal Search to test proof techniques, which are programs able to compute proofs concerning the system’s own future performance, based on an axiomatic system A encoded in p(1), describing a formal utility function u, the hardware and p(1) itself. If there is no provably good, globally optimal way of rewriting p(1) at all, then humans will not find one either. But if there is one, then p(1) itself can find and exploit it. This approach yields the first class of theoretically sound, fully self-referential, optimally efficient, general problem solvers. After the theoretical discussion, one practical question remains: to build a particular, especially practical Goedel machine with small initial constant overhead, which generally useful theorems should one add as axioms to A (as initial bias) such that the initial searcher does not have to prove them from scratch?"

#### ["On Learning to Think: Algorithmic Information Theory for Novel Combinations of Reinforcement Learning Controllers and Recurrent Neural World Models"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09249) Schmidhuber
>	"This paper addresses the general problem of reinforcement learning in partially observable environments. In 2013, our large RL recurrent neural networks learned from scratch to drive simulated cars from high-dimensional video input. However, real brains are more powerful in many ways. In particular, they learn a predictive model of their initially unknown environment, and somehow use it for abstract (e.g., hierarchical) planning and reasoning. Guided by algorithmic information theory, we describe RNN-based AIs designed to do the same. Such an RNNAI can be trained on never-ending sequences of tasks, some of them provided by the user, others invented by the RNNAI itself in a curious, playful fashion, to improve its RNN-based world model. Unlike our previous model-building RNN-based RL machines dating back to 1990, the RNNAI learns to actively query its model for abstract reasoning and planning and decision making, essentially “learning to think.” The basic ideas of this report can be applied to many other cases where one RNN-like system exploits the algorithmic information content of another."

>	"Real brains seem to be learning a predictive model of their initially unknown environment, but are still far superior to present artificial systems in many ways. They seem to exploit the model in smarter ways, e.g., to plan action sequences in hierarchical fashion, or through other types of abstract reasoning, continually building on earlier acquired skills, becoming increasingly general problem solvers able to deal with a large number of diverse and complex task."

>	"We introduced novel combinations of a RNNs-based reinforcement learning controller, C, and an RNN-based predictive world model, M. In a series of trials, an RNN controller C steers an agent interacting with an initially unknown, partially observable environment. The entire lifelong interaction history is stored, and used to train an RNN world model M, which learns to predict new inputs of C (including rewards) from histories of previous inputs and actions, using predictive coding to compress the history. Controller C may uses M to achieve its goals more efficiently, e.g., through cheap, “mental” M-based trials, as opposed to expensive trials in the real world. M is temporarily used as a surrogate for the environment: M and C form a coupled RNN where M’s outputs become inputs of C, whose outputs (actions) in turn become inputs of M. Now a gradient descent technique can be used to learn and plan ahead by training C in a series of M-simulated trials to produce output action sequences achieving desired input events, such as high real-valued reward signals (while the weights of M remain fixed). Given an RL problem, C may speed up its search for rewarding behavior by learning programs that address/query/exploit M’s program-encoded knowledge about predictable regularities, e.g., through extra connections from and to (a copy of) M. This may be much cheaper than learning reward-generating programs from scratch. C also may get intrinsic reward for creating experiments causing data with yet unknown regularities that improve M."

>	"The most general CM systems implement principles of algorithmic as opposed to traditional information theory. M is actively exploited in arbitrary computable ways by C, whose program search space is typically much smaller, and which may learn to selectively probe and reuse M’s internal programs to plan and reason. The basic principles are not limited to RL, but apply to all kinds of active algorithmic transfer learning from one RNN to another. By combining gradient-based RNNs and RL RNNs, we create a qualitatively new type of self-improving, general purpose, connectionist control architecture. This RNNAI may continually build upon previously acquired problem solving procedures, some of them self-invented in a way that resembles a scientist’s search for novel data with unknown regularities, preferring still-unsolved but quickly learnable tasks over others."

>	"Early CM systems did not yet use powerful RNNs such as LSTM. A more fundamental problem is that if the environment is too noisy, M will usually only learn to approximate the conditional expectations of predicted values, given parts of the history. In certain noisy environments, Monte Carlo Tree Sampling and similar techniques may be applied to M to plan successful future action sequences for C. All such methods, however, are about simulating possible futures time step by time step, without profiting from human-like hierarchical planning or abstract reasoning, which often ignores irrelevant details."

>	"This approach is different from other, previous combinations of traditional RL and RNNs which use RNNs only as value function approximators that directly predict cumulative expected reward, instead of trying to predict all sensations time step by time step. The CM system in the present section separates the hard task of prediction in partially observable environments from the comparatively simple task of RL under the Markovian assumption that the current input to C (which is M’s state) contains all information relevant for achieving the goal."

>	"Our RNN-based CM systems of the early 1990s could in principle plan ahead by performing numerous fast mental experiments on a predictive RNN world model, M, instead of time-consuming real experiments, extending earlier work on reactive systems without memory. However, this can work well only in (near-)deterministic environments, and, even there, M would have to simulate many entire alternative futures, time step by time step, to find an action sequence for C that maximizes reward. This method seems very different from the much smarter hierarchical planning methods of humans, who apparently can learn to identify and exploit a few relevant problem-specific abstractions of possible future events; reasoning abstractly, and efficiently ignoring irrelevant spatio-temporal details."

>	"According to Algorithmic Information Theory, given some universal computer, U, whose programs are encoded as bit strings, the mutual information between two programs p and q is expressed as K(q | p), the length of the shortest program w that computes q, given p, ignoring an additive constant of O(1) depending on U (in practical applications the computation will be time-bounded). That is, if p is a solution to problem P, and q is a fast (say, linear time) solution to problem Q, and if K(q | p) is small, and w is both fast and much shorter than q, then asymptotically optimal universal search for a solution to Q, given p, will generally find w first (to compute q and solve Q), and thus solve Q much faster than search for q from scratch."

>	"Let both C and M be RNNs or similar general parallel-sequential computers. M’s vector of learnable real-valued parameters wM is trained by any SL or UL or RL algorithm to perform a certain well-defined task in some environment. Then wM is frozen. Now the goal is to train C’s parameters wC by some learning algorithm to perform another well-defined task whose solution may share mutual algorithmic information with the solution to M’s task. To facilitate this, we simply allow C to learn to actively inspect and reuse (in essentially arbitrary computable fashion) the algorithmic information conveyed by M and wM."

>	"It means that now C’s relatively small candidate programs are given time to “think” by feeding sequences of activations into M, and reading activations out of M, before and while interacting with the environment. Since C and M are general computers, C’s programs may query, edit or invoke subprograms of M in arbitrary, computable ways through the new connections. Given some RL problem, according to the AIT argument, this can greatly accelerate C’s search for a problem-solving weight vector wˆ, provided the (time-bounded) mutual algorithmic information between wˆ and M’s program is high, as is to be expected in many cases since M’s environment-modeling program should reflect many regularities useful not only for prediction and coding, but also for decision making."

>	"This simple but novel approach is much more general than previous computable, but restricted, ways of letting a feedforward C use a model M, by simulating entire possible futures step by step, then propagating error signals or temporal difference errors backwards. Instead, we give C’s program search an opportunity to discover sophisticated computable ways of exploiting M’s code, such as abstract hierarchical planning and analogy-based reasoning. For example, to represent previous observations, an M implemented as an LSTM network will develop high-level, abstract, spatio-temporal feature detectors that may be active for thousands of time steps, as long as those memories are useful to predict (and thus compress) future observations. However, C may learn to directly invoke the corresponding “abstract” units in M by inserting appropriate pattern sequences into M. C might then short-cut from there to typical subsequent abstract representations, ignoring the long input sequences normally required to invoke them in M, thus quickly anticipating a few possible positive outcomes to be pursued (plus computable ways of achieving them), or negative outcomes to be avoided."

>	"Note that M (and by extension M) does not at all have to be a perfect predictor. For example, it won’t be able to predict noise. Instead M will have learned to approximate conditional expectations of future inputs, given the history so far. A naive way of exploiting M’s probabilistic knowledge would be to plan ahead through naive step-by-step Monte-Carlo simulations of possible M-predicted futures, to find and execute action sequences that maximize expected reward predicted by those simulations. However, we won’t limit the system to this naive approach. Instead it will be the task of C to learn to address useful problem-specific parts of the current M, and reuse them for problem solving. Sure, C will have to intelligently exploit M, which will cost bits of information (and thus search time for appropriate weight changes of C), but this is often still much cheaper in the AIT sense than learning a good C program from scratch."

>	"While M’s weights are frozen, the weights of C can learn when to make C attend to history information represented by M’s state, and when to ignore such information, and instead use M’s innards in other computable ways. This can be further facilitated by introducing a special unit, uˆ, to C, where uˆ(t)all(t) instead of all(t) is fed into M at time t, such that C can easily (by setting uˆ(t) = 0) force M to completely ignore environmental inputs, to use M for “thinking” in other ways."

>	"Given a new task and a C trained on several previous tasks, such hierarchical/incremental methods may freeze the current weights of C, then enlarge C by adding new units and connections which are trained on the new task. This process reduces the size of the search space for the new task, giving the new weights the opportunity to learn to use the frozen parts of C as subprograms."

>	"We motivate C to become an efficient explorer and an artificial scientist, by adding to its standard external reward (or fitness) for solving user-given tasks another intrinsic reward for generating novel action sequences (= experiments) that allow M to improve its compression performance on the resulting data. At first glance, repeatedly evaluating M’s compression performance on the entire history seems impractical. A heuristic to overcome this is to focus on M’s improvements on the most recent trial, while regularly re-training M on randomly selected previous trials, to avoid catastrophic forgetting. A related problem is that C’s incremental program search may find it difficult to identify (and assign credit to) those parts of C responsible for improvements of a huge, black box-like, monolithic M. But we can implement M as a self-modularizing, computation cost-minimizing, winner-take-all RNN. Then it is possible to keep track of which parts of M are used to encode which parts of the history. That is, to evaluate weight changes of M, only the affected parts of the stored history have to be re-tested. Then C’s search can be facilitated by tracking which parts of C affected those parts of M. By penalizing C’s programs for the time consumed by such tests, the search for C is biased to prefer programs that conduct experiments causing data yielding quickly verifiable compression progress of M. That is, the program search will prefer to change weights of M that are not used to compress large parts of the history that are expensive to verify. The first implementations of this simple principle were described in our work on the POWERPLAY framework, which incrementally searches the space of possible pairs of new tasks and modifications of the current program, until it finds a more powerful program that, unlike the unmodified program, solves all previously learned tasks plus the new one, or simplifies/compresses/speeds up previous solutions, without forgetting any. Under certain conditions this can accelerate the acquisition of external reward specified by user-defined tasks."

>	"What you describe is my other old RNN-based CM system from 1990: a recurrent controller C and a recurrent world model M, where C can use M to simulate the environment step by step and plan ahead. But the new stuff is different and much less limited - now C can learn to ask all kinds of computable questions to M (e.g., about abstract long-term consequences of certain subprograms), and get computable answers back. No need to simulate the world millisecond by millisecond (humans apparently don’t do that either, but learn to jump ahead to important abstract subgoals)."

>	"The ultimate optimal Bayesian approach to machine learning is embodied by the AIXI model. Any computational problem can be phrased as the maximization of a reward function. AIXI is based on Solomonoff's universal mixture M of all computable probability distributions. If the probabilities of the world's responses to some reinforcement learning agent's actions are computable (there is no physical evidence against that), then the agent may predict its future sensory inputs and rewards using M instead of the true but unknown distribution. The agent can indeed act optimally by choosing those action sequences that maximize M-predicted reward. This may be dubbed the unbeatable, ultimate statistical approach to AI - it demonstrates the mathematical limits of what's possible. However, AIXI’s notion of optimality ignores computation time, which is the reason why we are still in business with less universal but more practically feasible approaches such as deep learning based on more limited local search techniques such as gradient descent."

>	"Generally speaking, when it comes to Reinforcement Learning, it is indeed a good idea to train a recurrent neural network called M to become a predictive model of the world, and use M to train a separate controller network C which is supposed to generate reward-maximising action sequences. Marcus Hutter’s mathematically optimal universal AIXI also has a predictive world model M, and a controller C that uses M to maximise expected reward. Ignoring limited storage size, RNNs are general computers just like your laptop. That is, AIXI’s M is related to the RNN-based M above in the sense that both consider a very general space of predictive programs. AIXI’s M, however, really looks at all those programs simultaneously, while the RNN-based M uses a limited local search method such as gradient descent in program space (also known as backpropagation through time) to find a single reasonable predictive program (an RNN weight matrix). AIXI’s C always picks the action that starts the action sequence that yields maximal predicted reward, given the current M, which in a Bayes-optimal way reflects all the observations so far. The RNN-based C, however, uses a local search method (backpropagation through time) to optimise its program or weight matrix, using gradients derived from M. So in a way, my old RNN-based CM system of 1990 may be viewed as a limited, downscaled, sub-optimal, but at least computationally feasible approximation of AIXI."

#### ["Driven by Compression Progress: A Simple Principle Explains Essential Aspects of Subjective Beauty, Novelty, Surprise, Interestingness, Attention, Curiosity, Creativity, Art, Science, Music, Jokes"](http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4360) Schmidhuber
>	"I argue that data becomes temporarily interesting by itself to some self-improving, but computationally limited, subjective observer once he learns to predict or compress the data in a better way, thus making it subjectively simpler and more beautiful. Curiosity is the desire to create or discover more non-random, non-arbitrary, regular data that is novel and surprising not in the traditional sense of Boltzmann and Shannon but in the sense that it allows for compression progress because its regularity was not yet known. This drive maximizes interestingness, the first derivative of subjective beauty or compressibility, that is, the steepness of the learning curve. It motivates exploring infants, pure mathematicians, composers, artists, dancers, comedians, yourself, and artificial systems."

  Alex Graves:
> 	"To learn as fast as possible about a piece of data, decrease as rapidly as possible the number of bits you need to compress that data. This is exactly how probabilistic models are trained: ∇-log Pr(x). But what if you can choose which data to observe or even create your own? You should create the data that maximises the decrease in bits - the compression progress - of everything else you and your peers have ever observed. In other words, create the thing that makes the most sense of the world: art, science, music, jokes... Happiness is the first derivative of life!"

#### ["Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun, and Intrinsic Motivation"](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/ieeecreative.pdf) Schmidhuber
>	"The simple but general formal theory of fun & intrinsic motivation & creativity is based on the concept of maximizing intrinsic reward for the active creation or discovery of novel, surprising patterns allowing for improved prediction or data compression. It generalizes the traditional field of active learning, and is related to old but less formal ideas in aesthetics theory and developmental psychology. It has been argued that the theory explains many essential aspects of intelligence including autonomous development, science, art, music, humor. This overview first describes theoretically optimal (but not necessarily practical) ways of implementing the basic computational principles on exploratory, intrinsically motivated agents or robots, encouraging them to provoke event sequences exhibiting previously unknown but learnable algorithmic regularities. Emphasis is put on the importance of limited computational resources for online prediction and compression. Discrete and continuous time formulations are given. Previous practical but non-optimal implementations (1991, 1995, 1997-2002) are reviewed, as well as several recent variants by others (2005-). A simplified typology addresses current confusion concerning the precise nature of intrinsic motivation."

>	"I have argued that a simple but general formal theory of creativity based on reward for creating or finding novel patterns allowing for data compression progress explains many essential aspects of intelligence including science, art, music, humor. Here I discuss what kind of general bias towards algorithmic regularities we insert into our robots by implementing the principle, why that bias is good, and how the approach greatly generalizes the field of active learning. I provide discrete and continuous time formulations for ongoing work on building an Artificial General Intelligence based on variants of the artificial creativity framework."

>	"In the real world external rewards are rare. But unsupervised AGIs using additional intrinsic rewards as described in this paper will be motivated to learn many useful behaviors even in absence of external rewards, behaviors that lead to predictable or compressible results and thus reflect regularities in the environment, such as repeatable patterns in the world’s reactions to certain action sequences. Often a bias towards exploring previously unknown environmental regularities through artificial curiosity / creativity is a priori desirable because goal-directed learning may greatly profit from it, as behaviors leading to external reward may often be rather easy to compose from previously learnt curiosity-driven behaviors. It may be possible to formally quantify this bias towards novel patterns in form of a mixture-based prior, a weighted sum of probability distributions on sequences of actions and resulting inputs, and derive precise conditions for improved expected external reward intake. Intrinsic reward may be viewed as analogous to a regularizer in supervised learning, where the prior distribution on possible hypotheses greatly influences the most probable interpretation of the data in a Bayesian framework (for example, the well-known weight decay term of neural networks is a consequence of a Gaussian prior with zero mean for each weight). Following the introductory discussion, some of the AGIs based on the creativity principle will become scientists, artists, or comedians."

#### ["Unsupervised Minimax: Adversarial Curiosity, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Predictability Minimization"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04493) Schmidhuber
>	"I review unsupervised or self-supervised neural networks playing minimax games in game-theoretic settings. (i) Adversarial Curiosity (AC, 1990) is based on two such networks. One network learns to probabilistically generate outputs, the other learns to predict effects of the outputs. Each network minimizes the objective function maximized by the other. (ii) Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs, 2010-2014) are an application of AC where the effect of an output is 1 if the output is in a given set, and 0 otherwise. (iii) Predictability Minimization (PM, 1990s) models data distributions through a neural encoder that maximizes the objective function minimized by a neural predictor of the code components. We correct a previously published claim that PM is not based on a minimax game."

>	"Adversarial Curiosity: A reward-maximising neural control network C learns to generate outputs or experiments. A separate world model network M sees C's outputs, and learns to predict the reactions of the environment. C maximises errors minimised by M. This motivates C to generate experiments yielding "novel" data that still surprises M. GANs are a simple application of AC where the environment returns whether C's output is in a given set."

#### ["Curiosity Driven Reinforcement Learning for Motion Planning on Humanoids"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3881010/pdf/fnbot-07-00025.pdf) Frank, Leitner, Stollenga, Forster, Schmidhuber
>	"Most previous work on artificial curiosity and intrinsic motivation focuses on basic concepts and theory. Experimental results are generally limited to toy scenarios, such as navigation in a simulated maze, or control of a simple mechanical system with one or two degrees of freedom. To study AC in a more realistic setting, we embody a curious agent in the complex iCub humanoid robot. Our novel reinforcement learning framework consists of a state-of-the-art, low-level, reactive control layer, which controls the iCub while respecting constraints, and a high-level curious agent, which explores the iCub’s state-action space through information gain maximization, learning a world model from experience, controlling the actual iCub hardware in real-time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever embodied, curious agent for real-time motion planning on a humanoid. We demonstrate that it can learn compact Markov models to represent large regions of the iCub’s configuration space, and that the iCub explores intelligently, showing interest in its physical constraints as well as in objects it finds in its environment."

#### ["What's Interesting?"](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.45.6362) Schmidhuber
>	"Interestingness depends on the observer's current knowledge and computational abilities. Things are boring if either too much or too little is known about them --- if they appear either trivial or random. Interesting are unexpected regularities that seem easy to figure out. I attempt to implement these ideas in a "curious", "creative" explorer with two coevolving "brains". It executes a lifelong sequence of instructions whose modifiable probabilities are conditioned on both brains --- both must agree on each instruction. There are special instructions for comparing computational results. The brains can predict outcomes of such comparisons. If their opinions differ, then the winner will get rewarded, the loser punished. Hence each brain wants to lure the other into agreeing upon instruction subsequences involving comparisons that surprise it. The surprised brain adapts. In turn, the other loses a source of reward --- an incentive to shift the focus of interest. Both brains deal with the complex credit assignment problem using the recent Incremental Self-Improvement paradigm. Extensive simulations include an example where curiosity helps to speed up external reward."

----
>	"A single agent has two dueling, reward-maximizing policies called the left brain and the right brain. Each policy is a modifiable probability distribution over programs running on a general purpose computer. Experiments are programs sampled in a collaborative way that is influenced by both brains. Each experiment specifies how to execute an instruction sequence (which may affect both the environment and the agent’s internal state), and how to compute the outcome of the experiment through instructions implementing a computable function (possibly resulting in an internal binary yes/no classification) of the observation sequence triggered by the experiment. The modifiable parameters of both brains are instruction probabilities. They can be accessed and manipulated through programs that include subsequences of special self-referential policy-modifying instructions.  
>	Both brains may also trigger the execution of certain bet instructions whose effect is to predict experimental outcomes before they are observed. If their predictions or hypotheses differ, they may agree to execute the experiment to determine which brain was right, and the surprised loser will pay an intrinsic reward (the real-valued bet, e.g., 1.0) to the winner in a zero sum game.  
>	That is, each brain is intrinsically motivated to outwit or surprise the other by proposing an experiment such that the other agrees on the experimental protocol but disagrees on the predicted outcome, which is typically an internal computable abstraction of complex spatio-temporal events generated through the execution the self-invented experiment.  
>	This motivates the unsupervised two brain system to focus on "interesting" computational questions, losing interest in "boring" computations (potentially involving the environment) whose outcomes are consistently predictable by both brains, as well as computations whose outcomes are currently still hard to predict by any brain. Again, in the absence of external reward, each brain maximizes the value function minimised by the other.  
>	Using the meta-learning Success-Story RL algorithm, agent learns when to learn and what to learn. Agent will also minimize the computational cost of learning new skills, provided both brains receive a small negative reward for each computational step, which introduces a bias towards simple still surprising experiments (reflecting simple still unsolved problems). This may facilitate hierarchical construction of more and more complex experiments, including those yielding external reward (if there is any). In fact, this artificial creativity may not only drive artificial scientists and artists but can also accelerate the intake of external reward, intuitively because a better understanding of the world can help to solve certain problems faster."

#### ["PowerPlay: Training an Increasingly General Problem Solver by Continually Searching for the Simplest Still Unsolvable Problem"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.5309) Schmidhuber
>	"Most of computer science focuses on automatically solving given computational problems. I focus on automatically inventing or discovering problems in a way inspired by the playful behavior of animals and humans, to train a more and more general problem solver from scratch in an unsupervised fashion. Consider the infinite set of all computable descriptions of tasks with possibly computable solutions. Given a general problem solving architecture, at any given time, the novel algorithmic framework PowerPlay searches the space of possible pairs of new tasks and modifications of the current problem solver, until it finds a more powerful problem solver that provably solves all previously learned tasks plus the new one, while the unmodified predecessor does not. Newly invented tasks may require to achieve a wow-effect by making previously learned skills more efficient such that they require less time and space. New skills may (partially) re-use previously learned skills. The greedy search of typical PowerPlay variants uses time-optimal program search to order candidate pairs of tasks and solver modifications by their conditional computational (time & space) complexity, given the stored experience so far. The new task and its corresponding task-solving skill are those first found and validated. This biases the search towards pairs that can be described compactly and validated quickly. The computational costs of validating new tasks need not grow with task repertoire size. Standard problem solver architectures of personal computers or neural networks tend to generalize by solving numerous tasks outside the self-invented training set; PowerPlay’s ongoing search for novelty keeps breaking the generalization abilities of its present solver. This is related to Goedel’s sequence of increasingly powerful formal theories based on adding formerly unprovable statements to the axioms without affecting previously provable theorems. The continually increasing repertoire of problem solving procedures can be exploited by a parallel search for solutions to additional externally posed tasks. PowerPlay may be viewed as a greedy but practical implementation of basic principles of creativity."

----
>	"Pure scientists do not only invent new methods to solve given problems. They also invent new problems. The recent PowerPlay framework formalizes this type of curiosity and creativity in a new, general, yet practical way. To acquire problem solving prowess through playing, PowerPlay-based artificial explorers by design continually come up with the fastest to find, initially novel, but eventually solvable problems. They also continually simplify or speed up solutions to previous problems. We report on results of first experiments with PowerPlay. A self-delimiting recurrent neural network (SLIM RNN) is used as a general computational architecture to implement the system’s solver. Its weights can encode arbitrary, self-delimiting, halting or non-halting programs affecting both environment (through effectors) and internal states encoding abstractions of event sequences. In open-ended fashion, our PowerPlay-driven RNNs learn to become increasingly general problem solvers, continually adding new problem solving procedures to the growing repertoire, exhibiting interesting developmental stages."
